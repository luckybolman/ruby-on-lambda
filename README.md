# Ruby on AWS Lambda

## Why?

Because:

- AWS Lambda is pretty darn cool
- AWS Lambda doesn't officially support Ruby (yet)
- Significant, existing Ruby programs could benefit

## How?

By:

- building a local test harness with some script tooling
- packaging a Ruby binary with the code
- shelling out to Ruby from (for example) NodeJS

## Usage

1. Install aws cli tools
2. Ensure you're using ruby 2.1.x in this directory
3.
